## A directory comparer with a GUI

#### Description: Using pyinstaller my program made with the filecmp library and tkinter library wasn’t made into a fully based GUI application. This works by taking two folders to compare, a directory for output, and the name of the txt file the user would like to create. Once this information is submitted a text file is created at the desired location detailing all the differences between the two selected folders.
